# Crisis-Analysis
Quantitative analysis of crisis events as part of D.Phil project at Oxford.
Markdown copies included for viewing from within GitHub.

## Research Question
The primary goal of this research is to develop methods by which to filter
social media content that is generated during crisis events for messages which
contain 'ground truth' information.



These notebooks represent ongoing analyses used throughout my research and are
written up in more detail in their corresponding papers and thesis.

The data used in the Twitter-based work have been collecting using custom
software available in my crisis-data repository. This data is accessed using
Django queries from within the notebooks to pull data into dataframes.


## TODO
Fix dataframe style formatting in markdown conversion.
