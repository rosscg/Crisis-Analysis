    "# User Location Classification in Hurricane Harvey\n",
    "This is the first notebook in a series which are written primarily as a research logbook for the author. They are therefore not to be considered complete and do not represent the final analysis. For this -- see the final published papers and thesis, or contact the author directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to evaluate methods by which users Tweeting about Hurricane Harvey may be classified as in the area or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected with custom software which observed several Twitter streams and enhanced this information by querying the Twitter REST APIs for the network data (friends and followers) of each author. Stream volume which exceeded the capacity of the REST requests was discarded. \n",
    "* The keyword stream monitored the terms: [#harvey, #harveystorm, #hurricaneharvey, #corpuschristi]\n",
    "* The GPS stream used the bounding box: [-99.9590682, 26.5486063, -93.9790001, 30.3893434]\n",
    "* The collection period ran from 2017-08-26 01:32:18 until 2017-09-02 10:30:52 \n",
    "* 55,605 Tweets by 33,585 unique authors were recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was coded using an interface built into the collection software by a primary coder. A secondary coder coded a sub-set of coded users for validation of the coding schema. User instances were coded by whether they 'appeared to be in the affected area'.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks access the data directly from the database using standard Django query syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Cleaning & Enrichment\n",
    "In this chapter, we will investigate the data which was collected by the custom software. It is assessed for suitability for machine learning approaches, and enriched with synthesised features. The final result is a dataframe which is ready for statistical techniques which are presented in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we get all the coding instances made by the primary and secondary coders, and check the total codings of each class. There may be multiple coding dimensions (sets of coding schema), in which case the code requires adjustment to constrain to one."

The coders were instructed to determine whether the user account was in an area affected by the hurricane at any point during the data collection period. Therefore, the term 'local' may be misleading to the reader, as the definition given to the coders will include anyone visiting the area as, for example, a responder or aid worker. This larger set of 'on the ground' users is a more useful target for classification."

    "A visual inspection of the follower/friend network of detected users (pictured above) shows a clear community structure. This suggests that there are certain user features that influence the propensity for a user to follow another user with similar features. These may be features which we have observed and recorded, or other features which we cannot predict. This can be tested by using community detection algorithms to partition the nodes of the graph into these communities, and then comparing these partitions to features with which they may be associated. Primarily, we are interested in whether these communities are related to whether a user is a 'witness' or not, as per our manual coding. If this is the case, the community metrics can be a useful feature in our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows a representation of the same network structure, where only the 1500 coded nodes are displayed in colours which represent their codes. The general grouping of orange nodes towards one section of the graph which corresponds with a community cluster shown in the original graph structure suggests that this community contains a greater proportion of witness nodes and therefore is a dependent feature. A preliminary hypothesis is that local users are more likely to follow one another (thus forming this community) and are also more likely to be witnesses. If true, this community could accurately predict which users are local and therefore, more likely to be witnesses.\n",

Alternatively, communities may exhibit different characteristics such as connectedness. This will be explored later.

    "While the analysis above demonstrates the predictive power of these algorithms at the end point of an event, once the graph data is most rich, the purpose of this research is to classify user objects as they are detected. Therefore, we need to test the efficacy of these algorithms on partial graphs, as they appeared throughout the data collection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected over the course of several days for this event, therefore we can create subgraphs at intervals an re-calculate the metrics discussed above. This function creates a subgraph as it existed at every 24-hour interval from the event start time. Therefore, for the Hurricane Harvey event, which was recorded over 7 days and 10 hours, 7 sub-graphs are generated. With the final graph, there are a total of 8 graphs. Each graph contains all the data of the graph preceding it plus the newly observed users and their common relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same transormations as above are then applied and the association measures calculated. It is expected that the measures increase over time, as the network structure is revealed. We are therefore interested in observing the rate at which is happens."
