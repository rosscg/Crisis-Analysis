    "# User Location Classification in Hurricane Harvey\n",
    "This is the second notebook in a series which are written primarily as a research logbook for the author. They are therefore not to be considered complete and do not represent the final analysis. For this -- see the final published papers and thesis, or contact the author directly.\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to evaluate methods by which users Tweeting about Hurricane Harvey may be classified as in the area or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected with custom software which observed several Twitter streams and enhanced this information by querying the Twitter REST APIs for the network data (friends and followers) of each author. Stream volume which exceeded the capacity of the REST requests was discarded. \n",
    "* The keyword stream monitored the terms: [#harvey, #harveystorm, #hurricaneharvey, #corpuschristi]\n",
    "* The GPS stream used the bounding box: [-99.9590682, 26.5486063, -93.9790001, 30.3893434]\n",
    "* The collection period ran from 2017-08-26 01:32:18 until 2017-09-02 10:30:52 \n",
    "* 55,605 Tweets by 33,585 unique authors were recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was coded using an interface built into the collection software by a primary coder. A secondary coder coded a sub-set of coded users for validation of the coding schema. User instances were coded by whether they 'appeared to be in the affected area'.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks access the data directly from the database using standard Django query syntax."
