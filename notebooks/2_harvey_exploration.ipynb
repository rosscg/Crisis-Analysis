    "The results above are as expected. Excluding empty fields gives a precision/recall of 0.650/0.668 whereas exluding them gives 0.433/0.793. The exclusion strategy provides the highest f1 score, however given the purpose of the algorithm must be considered when choosing how to weight precision and recall metrics. For example, given the algorithm is designed to curate the feed for human consumption, a high precision is only necessary if the rate of positive cases exceeds the humans' ability to parse the incoming stream. Where the rate is low, sacrificing precision is acceptable to present the human user with more cases which they can then manually filter. \n",

The location of the device is provided by the hardware and automatically included with the Tweet (thus the user does not influence the input). A Tweet may also include, instead of specific coordinates, a 'Place' object -- a geographic region (defined by Twitter) which typically describes a location such as a city, state or other similarly-sized region.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this dataset, the Twitter feed for each observed user spanning the duration of the collection period was collected at the end of the collection period. The feed is therefore made up of Tweets detected during the collection period, and any other Tweets the user made during the period, before or after the detected Tweet, provided they existed at the end of the collection period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further work on this area should consider the following:\n",
    "* Where a local Tweet has been detected, check the proportion of other Tweets containing geographic data.\n",
    "* Where other geo-Tweets exist, check whether they are from the same point or move around -- consider recoding for where a user Tweets from within *and* without the bounding box.\n",
    "* Where all geo-Tweets come from the same point, it is likely that location has been manually set (i.e. it is a storefront/business account). This may be verifiable by checking the Tweet source."

When creating a third-party application which can interact with the Twitter API, a developer must provide a descriptor string which populates this field. Because many third-party applications are designed for specific use-cases, this field provides useful information which characterises the motivations for conditions under which the Tweet was created. For example, the source `TweetMyJOBS` refers to a recruitment platform and thus is attached to Tweets advertising job listings.\n",
