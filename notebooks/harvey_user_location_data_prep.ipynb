    "A visual inspection of the follower/friend network of detected users (pictured above) shows a clear community structure. This suggests that there are certain user features that influence the propensity for a user to follow another user with similar features. These may be features which we have observed and recorded, or other features which we cannot predict. This can be tested by using community detection algorithms to partition the nodes of the graph into these communities, and then comparing these partitions to features with which they may be associated. Primarily, we are interested in whether these communities are related to whether a user is a 'witness' or not, as per our manual coding. If this is the case, the community metrics can be a useful feature in our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows a representation of the same network structure, where only the 1500 coded nodes are displayed in colours which represent their codes. The general grouping of orange nodes towards one section of the graph which corresponds with a community cluster shown in the original graph structure suggests that this community contains a greater proportion of witness nodes and therefore is a dependent feature. A preliminary hypothesis is that local users are more likely to follow one another (thus forming this community) and are also more likely to be witnesses. If true, this community could accurately predict which users are local and therefore, more likely to be witnesses.\n",

    "## Evaluating Community Algorithms\n",
    "In the following section, the original dataframe is enhanced with modularity metrics. These are features which are calculated based upon the graph structure of the user friend/follower network. There are a number of community detection algorithms, so a set of these have been calculated to be tested and compared for association to the target (witness) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community metrics were calculated using the `networkx` implementations of `greedy_modularity_communities`, `label_propagation_communities`, `asyn_lpa_communities`, `asyn_fluidc` and `community_louvain` from the `community` package. These were performed in a separate script for the sake of testing and will ideally be calculated by the data collection software at the end of the collection process in future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph includes all detected users (i.e. not their followers/friends unless they were also detected as authors) for a total of 31,496 nodes and 99,602 edges. Community detection was performed on subgraph representing the largest connected component of 17,958 nodes and 75,203 edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "As most algorithms require an undirected graph, the direction of relationships was ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communities are labelled as numbers according to their ranking in size (where 0 is the largest), thus the labels have some level of ordinality."

    "From inspecting the graphs above, there appears to be a disproportionate amount of positive cases in certain communities, suggesting some association between community (as detected by a given algorithm) and the classification. Therefore, it is likely that including these metrics will increase the information available to the predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charts shown above suggest that the highest proportion of positive classes appear in the largest, or second-largest communities (as the labels have been ranked in order of size). This is significant -- a model cannot be trained on community label as a feature, as the labels are qualitative and will be different each time an algorithm runs on a network. Therefore these features cannot generalise to new datasets. The feature that is supplied must therefore be something which is generalisable; in this case, the ranking of the community by size my be appropriate (for example, a feature which represents whether a user is in the largest detected community). Alternatively, communities may exhibit different characteristics such as connectedness. This will be explored later. The higher proportions seen in some of the later communities are less relevant as these are of a much smaller size. Thus the high proportions are 'easier' to achieve, and as smaller communities are more likely to represent unique cases, they are less likely to generalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps in the analyis of the validity of this approach is the calculate whether the disparities observed above are statistically significant. That is, whether these associations could have been observed by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, for each community detection algorithm, we are testing the hypotheses:\n",
    "$$H_0: \\text{There is no association between the community label and witness label}$$\n",
    "$$H_A: \\text{There is an association between the community label and witness label}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-squre analysis is performed on the output of each detection algorithm with the target class. Note that communities with a size below 5 are removed as per the recommendation for chi-square analysis."
