# General data questions and exploration



```python
# Try ML with and without network metrics
# Test at different time periods
# Test other event datasets
# Check steps from book - change to best practice sklearn


# What correlates with witness label
# GPS accounts tend to be spam/businesses?
# Compare GPS from stream / profile / hand coding
# Explore age of account
# Is detecting co-occuring tags viable?
# What kind of data/user is likely to be deleted?
# Is user name change / user deletion/protection a useful predictor
# Compare Change in network, whether it's useful to collect.
# Check gps count, location in profile
# Check timezone distribution
# 'Ordinary person' vs bot/celeb/business/news -- using source field, tweet rate, timezone

# prop of gps -- users and tweets. Automated, instagram sourced?
# prop of sources
# prop of media/urls
# users with location on profile? Some set 'in solidarity'?
# Cycadian posting rythym - can identify real people vs bots?
# location via friend network?

# \item Tweets which were automatically generated from Instagram posts were much more likely to include GPS coordinates, and as media, more likely to represent a ground truth. Therefore this content may be worth focusing on.
# \item Aid requests were very rare. Those that were identified were often reposts rather than originals, and are often referring to the same original message which begins to trend.
# \item Info for affected class should differentiate between immediate and non-immediate content. E.g. a call to mobilise a clean-up or rescue crew vs. a link to an insurance claim form.
# \item For `unrelated' messages, those which matched the keyword stream were highly represented by automated messages coming from a particular set of sources which presumably uses trending tags to gain exposure. This is easy to pre-filter.
# \item Geographically-tagged Tweets are predominantly either: Instagram cross-posts, or automatically generated job listings from a small set of sources (and therefore easy to pre-filter).
